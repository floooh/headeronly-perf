    sokol_time.h    -- simple cross-platform time measurement

    Do this:
        #define SOKOL_IMPL
    before you include this file in *one* C or C++ file to create the 
    implementation.

    Optionally provide the following defines with your own implementations:
    SOKOL_ASSERT(c)     - your own assert macro (default: assert(c))
    SOKOL_API_DECL      - public function declaration prefix (default: extern)
    SOKOL_API_IMPL      - public function implementation prefix (default: -)

    void stm_setup();
        Call once before any other functions to initialize sokol_time
        (this calls for instance QueryPerformanceFrequency on Windows)

    uint64_t stm_now();
        Get current point in time in unspecified 'ticks'. The value that
        is returned has no relation to the 'wall-clock' time and is
        not in a specific time unit, it is only useful to compute
        time differences.

    uint64_t stm_diff(uint64_t new, uint64_t old);
        Computes the time difference between new and old. This will always
        return a positive, non-zero value.

    uint64_t stm_since(uint64_t start);
        Takes the current time, and returns the elapsed time since start
        (this is a shortcut for "stm_diff(stm_now(), start)")

    uint64_t stm_laptime(uint64_t* last_time);
        This is useful for measuring frame time and other recurring
        events. It takes the current time, returns the time difference
        to the value in last_time, and stores the current time in
        last_time for the next call. If the value in last_time is 0,
        the return value will be zero (this usually happens on the
        very first call).

    Use the following functions to convert a duration in ticks into
    useful time units:

    double stm_sec(uint64_t ticks);
    double stm_ms(uint64_t ticks);
    double stm_us(uint64_t ticks);
    double stm_ns(uint64_t ticks);
        Converts a tick value into seconds, milliseconds, microseconds
        or nanoseconds. Note that not all platforms will have nanosecond
        or even microsecond precision.

    Uses the following time measurement functions under the hood:

    Windows:        QueryPerformanceFrequency() / QueryPerformanceCounter()
    MacOS/iOS:      mach_absolute_time()
    emscripten:     clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)
    Linux+others:   clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONITONIC)
